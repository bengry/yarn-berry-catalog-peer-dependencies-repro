# @acme/ui-legacy

⚠️ **DEPRECATED - Legacy React 18 Library**

This library is stuck on React 18 due to a third-party dependency (`legacy-react-library`) that hasn't been updated to support React 19.

**Please use `@acme/ui-next` instead for new projects.**

This package is maintained only for existing projects that cannot migrate yet.

## Why can't this be upgraded?

The `legacy-react-library` dependency is no longer maintained and only supports React 18. Upgrading to React 19 would break this package.

## Migration Path

Switch to `@acme/ui-next` which uses React 19 and provides the same functionality without the legacy dependency.
